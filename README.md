# Prakash Bank - A Comprehensive Bank Management System

Welcome to **Prakash Bank**, a robust and scalable Bank Management System built with Django. This project is designed to provide a seamless banking experience with a focus on security, flexibility, and user roles. Whether you're a customer managing your accounts, a staff member handling day-to-day operations, a branch manager overseeing transactions, or an admin managing the entire system, Prakash Bank is tailored to meet all your needs.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Prakash Bank is an end-to-end solution for managing banking operations. The system incorporates various user roles, each with distinct permissions, ensuring that operations are secure and well-managed.

### Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Four distinct roles—Customer, Staff, Branch Manager, and Admin—each with tailored permissions to ensure secure and efficient operations.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication to protect your users' data and maintain session security.
- **Custom Validation:** Enhanced validation mechanisms when creating accounts and users to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Management Command (`seed`):** A custom command that runs all migrations, migrates the database, and creates a superuser with the Admin role defined.
- **Custom Renderer:** Tailored response rendering to provide meaningful feedback and consistent API responses.
- **Custom Pagination:** Optimized pagination class to manage large datasets efficiently.

## 🛠️ Key Components

### 1. **User Roles & Permissions**

Each user role in Prakash Bank has specific permissions:

- **Customer:** Manage personal accounts, view transactions, request services.

The system includes custom validations for account and user creation to maintain data consistency and integrity. These validations help prevent common issues like duplicate accounts and invalid user data.

### 4. **Management Command (`seed`)**

The `seed` management command simplifies the initial setup of the project by automating the migration process and creating an Admin superuser.

### 5. **Custom Renderer & Pagination**
