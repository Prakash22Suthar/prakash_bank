### 4. **Management Command (`seed`)**

The `seed` management command simplifies the initial setup of the project by automating the migration process and creating an Admin superuser.

### 5. **Custom Renderer & Pagination**

- **Custom Renderer:** Tailored API responses to ensure consistency and clarity in feedback.
- **Custom Pagination:** Efficient handling of large datasets, providing a seamless user experience when navigating through extensive data.

### 6. **Postman Collection & Swagger Documentation**
